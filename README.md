#Attendance System for Students Based on Face Recognition
This project is an attendance system for students that uses face recognition technology. It is built using OpenCV, a popular computer vision library.

#Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy
Pandas

#Installation

1-Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/attendance-system.git

2-Install the required libraries:
pip install opencv-python numpy pandas

3-Run the project:
python tkin.py

#Usage

The attendance system is designed to work in the following way:

The system captures an image of the student's face using the webcam.
The image is processed using OpenCV to extract the facial features.
The facial features are compared to a database of known faces to identify the student.
If the student is identified, their attendance is recorded in  databes attendnace table.
